## Introduction
We present a fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram" target="\_blank" title="What are Cartograms?">cartogram</a> generator written in C. It uses the flow-based algorithm devised by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712674115" target="\_blank">Gastner, Seguy & More</a>.

This readme explains how to set up and use this software. 
In doing so, it uses data from the 2016 United States presidential election. 
These data are included in the repository.

## Input data format
The cartogram generator expects two input file. You will need to obtain the '.json' file. The '.csv' file will be generated by the cartogram generator from the '.json' file. If you do not have a '.json' file, please follow the steps listed here: https://github.com/Flow-Based-Cartograms/go_cart/blob/master/process_map_file.md

1. a '.json' file containing the cartesian coordinates for the map regions under consideration. For example, for the 2016 US presidential election data we provide `usa_contiguous_arcgis.json` (in the `sample_data` folder) which includes the coordinates for the boundaries of the different states of the contiguous United States. The file needs to adhere to the GeoJSON specifications and needs to be processed first.

2. a '.csv' file containing the data (such as population) for each region, according to which these will be scaled. For the 2016 US presidential election data we provide `usa_contiguous_electors.csv` (in the `sample_data` folder) which provides the number of electors for each state. The csv file will be generated by the cartogram generator. You will then need to add in the data to the csv file.

The `.csv` file should be in the following format:
```
Region.Id,Region.Data,Region.Name
1,9,Alabama
2,11,Arizona
3,6,Arkansas
4,55,California
5,9,Colorado
6,7,Connecticut
7,3,Delaware
8,3,District of Columbia
...
```

## Building the cartogram generator

### Dependencies

#### macOS
You must have `Xcode Command Line Tools` and the `brew` package manager <a href="https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/" title="How to install Xcode CLT & brew?" target="\_blank">installed</a> (and updated) on your computer.

#### Ubuntu/Debian Linux
No additional dependencies. Your default `apt-get` package manager should work fine.

### Building (macOS & Linux)

1. Open a terminal, clone the repository, and navigate to its root directory.

2. Run the provided automatic build script. This will install the required dependencies and run configure and make for you:
```
sudo bash autobuild.sh
```

3. The `cartogram` executable can be found under `cartogram_generator/`. To install it, run the following command:
```
sudo make install
```

4. Once you have installed it, you can run the cartogram generator at the command line by running `cartogram`:
```
$ cartogram
USAGE:
Process GeoJSON File: cartogram -p json_file_name
Generate Cartogram:   cartogram [-dei] -g map_file_name -a area_file_name
                      OR:
                      cartogram [-dei] -g map_file_name -s
-d: use Gastner-Newman (i.e. diffusion) method
-e: generate cartogram figure in EPS format
-i: calculate inverse transform
```

**Note:** If you run into issues, look at the [**Troubleshooting**](#troubleshooting) section below.

## Running the cartogram generator

First, you need to process the '.json' file. If you do not have a '.json' file, please follow the tutorial here: https://github.com/Flow-Based-Cartograms/go_cart/blob/master/process_map_file.md

Process the '.json' file using the following command:
```
cartogram -p json_file_name
```

The cartogram will generate 2 new files: a processedmap '.json' file and '.csv' file. Fill in the data in the '.csv' file. Then, run the following command to generate the cartogram.
```
cartogram [-edi] -g processedmap_file_name -a csv_file_name
```
### Examples

For the 2016 US presidential election data, navigate to the `sample_data/` directory, and run the following command. Note that the sample data has **already been processed** using `cartogram -p`
```
cartogram -g usa_contiguous_arcgis.json -a usa_contiguous_electors.csv
```

If you supply the **-e** option, you should see two generated files:

- `map.eps` shows the original map
- `cartogram.eps` shows the generated cartogram.

On macOS, open using
```
open <filename>.eps
```
On Linux, open using
```
evince <filename>.eps
```
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file (`map` or `cartogram`) you wish to open.

For our example, `map.eps` should look as follows:

<p align="center">
<img src ="sample_images/usa_map.png" width="65%">
</p>

And here is how `cartogram.eps` should look like:

<p align="center">
<img src ="sample_images/usa_cartogram_electors.png" width="65%">
</p>

### Options

**-e**<br/>
> Output an EPS file of the original map (`map.eps`) and the cartogram (`cartogram.eps`)

**-d**<br/>
> Use Gastner-Newman (i.e. diffusion) instead of fast flow-based method

**-i**<br/>
> Print inverse transform to file

**-g**<br/>
> Location of the .gen/.json/.geojson file for the original map

**-a**<br/>
> Location of the area information file (.csv/.dat). Cannot be used with **-s**.

**-s**<br/>
> Read the area information from `stdin`, and output the cartogram gen file to `stdout`. Cannot be used with **-a**.


## Troubleshooting
In case you run into problems while building the generator using the automated script, you could try manually carrying out some of the steps.

#### macOS
1. Install fftw and gcc.
```
$ brew install fftw
$ brew install gcc
```
2. Note down the version of `gcc` installed. For example, if `gcc-8.1.0` is installed, your version would be `8` (not 8.1.0).

3. Run configure and pass it the compiler information
```
$ CC=gcc-[your-version-number] ./configure
```

4. Run make
```
$ make
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian Linux
1. Make sure everything is up to date. Then install fftw and gcc.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

2. Make sure you are in the root directory, and then run the remaining steps.
```
$ ./configure && make
```

#### Error (macOS): Don't understand 'm' flag!

If you see the following line in your output, you may want to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/1945" target="\_blank">this solution</a>.
```
FATAL:/opt/local/bin/../libexec/as/x86_64/as: I don't understand 'm' flag!
